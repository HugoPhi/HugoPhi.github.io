## Why Rust?

â€‹	Rust is a systems programming language designed to provide memory safety, concurrency, and high performance while avoiding common issues found in traditional systems programming languages like C and C++, such as null pointer dereferencing, memory leaks, and data races. Rust's design philosophy emphasizes **safety**, **concurrency**, and **speed**, making it an ideal choice for building efficient and secure applications. 
â€‹	Rust is developed by Mozilla and is open-source. Its syntax is similar to modern programming languages and offers high expressiveness. One of Rust's core features is its **Ownership** and **Borrowing** system, which allows for automatic memory management without the need for garbage collection (GC), avoiding problems like memory leaks and dangling pointers. 
â€‹	Rust supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented programming (through structs and traits), functional programming (via closures and higher-order functions), and concurrent programming (using lightweight threads and asynchronous programming), offering powerful expressiveness and flexibility.

### ðŸ”¥ Main Features

- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership system and borrowing checker ensure memory safety, preventing common memory issues such as dangling pointers and memory leaks.
- **Concurrency**: Rust's concurrency model eliminates data races by utilizing ownership, borrowing, and locks, providing thread-safe concurrency support.
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Rust's abstractions (such as generics, traits, and closures) are highly efficient, with minimal runtime overhead, ensuring high execution performance.
- **Modern Syntax**: Rust has a modern, easy-to-understand syntax that is still suitable for low-level systems programming.
- **No Garbage Collection**: Rust manages memory through ownership and lifetimes, without relying on a garbage collector, leading to better performance.
